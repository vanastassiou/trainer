        "details": "For exercise: longer limbs create longer moment arms, requiring more work through the same angular range. Taller lifters often benefit from wider stances and adjusted grip widths. For health assessment: waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is a stronger predictor of cardiometabolic risk than BMI or waist circumference alone. A WHtR below 0.5 indicates lower risk regardless of sex or ethnicity, while values above 0.6 indicate substantially elevated risk. This ratio normalizes waist measurement across different body sizes, making it more universally applicable than fixed waist thresholds.",
